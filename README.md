Finder of maximum flow of a network without intersecting path.

** Overview **

	A given number of ants start in a single room and needs 
	to reach the end room, there are many other rooms which 
	are connected with pipes. Each move consists of moving 
	an ant from a room to its neighbors without having two
	ants in a single room at any given time. The goal is to
	make as few moves as possible.
